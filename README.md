# CSGO-ML-Classification
Counter Strike: Global Offensive Binary Classification model developed using ML algorithms
################################################################################################################
Built a CSGO Binary Classification model using Machine Learning algorithms in Python which considers excel file as input. This data set was downloaded from
"https://www.kaggle.com/christianlillelund/csgo-round-winner-classification". The dataset consists of round snapshots from about 700 demos from high level tournament play in 2019
and 2020. Kindly refer to the above kaggle link for more dataset details. Our goal is to compute the round winner as 'CT' or 'T' based on the round statistics like map,bomb_planted,t_health,ct_health,t_armor,ct_armor etc. Classification models used are Logistic regression, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classifier, K-NN, Support Vector Machines(SVM) .
